The MarMix's dashboard
----------------------

Your starting point when using MarMix is the dashboard. You will be redirected to the dashboard after signing in or you
can use the "Dashboard" link in the main menu of MarMix. The dashboard is not directly used during simulations, but it
summarizes all information tied to your personal account: your profile, teams xxx, simulations tools, connexion and
login information to data sources, past simulations and rankings.

Profile
*******

This section (:num:`Figure #account-dashboard-profile`) summarizes all the personal information regarding your account that are stored by MarMix (you can see
how little we know about you because we really care about your privacy).

Changing your email address
...........................

If you need to change your email address, simply click on the "Edit" button next to your email address. You will have to
provide your new email address and go to the same validation procedure as you did during your account creation
(see the :ref:`create a new account <account-create-a-new-account>` section for more information).

After having validated your new email address, you will have to go back to your dashboard and click on the "Edit" button
one more time in order to select the newly created address as your *primary* address. The *primary* address is the address
that we will use to send you automated messages from the platform (password retrieval, account status, transactions
summary, etc.).

Changing your profile picture
.............................

We offer the possibility to customize your profile picture in order to identify the person who made some specific
transactions in your team. This is not really required, but could be interesting if you want to recall which transactions
you or one of your colleague did.

To change the picture, simply click on the current picture, upload a new one (jpg or png format, max 500x500 px) and
select the new picture as the default one.

After changing your picture, it takes some time util the new picture appears on every page. So don't hurry and enjoy
your new public face on MarMix.

Permissions
...........

Depending on your role inside your university, you may have some sort of wonderful super powers on MarMix. The status
of your current super powers is displayed under your profile. On MarMix, we give 4 types of super powers:

- **Active**: any account with a valid email address has the active super powers
- **Manager**: you have the power to create and administer simulations for your classes
- **Staff**: your are able to manage entire organisations, create managers and teams
- **Superuser**: nobody has more super powers than you have! However, is you are not a MarMix collaborator, something is really wrong.

Team
****

Depending on the choices made by your organisation, you can be member of one or more teams. One team membership is the
minimum needed to be able to use the platform. Your current enrollment in teams is displayed in the **Team** box
(:num:`Figure #account-dashboard-teams2`).
